# AutonomousRobotWithApp

The folder webot_proj2 is the root directory of the project. The world file is called task1-world.wbt

The folder CADT contains iOS app project files. The project uses Firebase SDK and "cocoapods" was used as a dependency management tool.
If you want to open the app, be sure to run "pod install" command in the root directory of the app project (which is CADT)

The Python file also uses Firebase SDK, and you need to create your own project in Firebase Console to create your own encrypted key to access Cloud Storage.
